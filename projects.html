                <p>  This website was originally built as a part of a 24-hour hackathon  <span class="highlight">Buildofolio</span>, where the goal was to design a fully functional and personalized portfolio site from scratch. The project showcases my ability to build responsive, clean, and professional interfaces under strict time constraints..</p>
                
                <p>        While this is currently the only featured project on the page, it demonstrates my foundational knowledge of modern frontend tools including React, JavaScript, and component-based UI design. More dynamic features and interactive sections are being planned to make this page richer.</p>
                
                <p> I’m actively working on several other projects, including full-stack web applications and data-driven platforms using tools like Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and AI-based technologies. Once those are ready for display, they will be added here with detailed descriptions and GitHub links.
